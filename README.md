# CountryApp

Countries information application. Made with Angular and Bootstrap, this app makes use of the https://restcountries.com/v3.1 API to make searchs of countries by different parameters such as country, capital city or region. Then, the information is displayed in the front end dynamically.

This project was made as a sort of exercise, for me to grasp the fundamentals of Angular. I have enjoyed it a lot and can't wait to build more projects with this framework!
